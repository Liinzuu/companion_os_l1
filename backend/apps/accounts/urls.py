"""
Accounts app — URL routes.

Three routes:
- login/   → Django's built-in LoginView (we just give it a template)
- logout/  → Django's built-in LogoutView (redirects to login)
- register/ → our own RegisterView (Django has no built-in register)

Why use Django's built-in views for login/logout?
They handle: wrong password logic, session creation, CSRF protection, brute-force
rate limiting hooks. Writing this from scratch would be reinventing a well-tested wheel.
